Mikoa py is a python script that scrapes Tanzania's locaition data from the government's official source, Napa.

we want a list of regions +
a list of districts referencing regions they belong to +
a list of wards referencing their districts +
a list of streets if available +
postcode



Instructions:
I'd package it but I am too behind on the schedule that pays me... so;
1. All packages used here are from the standard library(python 3.10) so there is no need for a virtual env 
2. To get a json of regions:

if you're on windows go


> "python regions.py" 


And If you are cool go

> "python3 regions.py"


same for districts and wards
